          Logo The future of India will be shaped by todayâ€™s younger generation
          who need quality education through digital literacy, making them
          productive and self-reliant citizens. 'Digital literacy' is the skills
          required to achieve digital competence and use of Information and
          Communication Technology (ICT) for work, leisure, learning and
          communication. It does not replace traditional forms of literacy,
          instead complements and amplifies the skills that form the foundation
          of traditional forms.
